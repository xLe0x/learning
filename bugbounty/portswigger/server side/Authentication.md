## What is authentication?

To Summarize, Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client.
***whether It's a email and password OR a biometrics such as your fingerprint and so on***

## What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

***Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.***

For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the usernameÂ `Carlos123`Â really is the same person who created the account.

OnceÂ `Carlos123`Â is authenticated, their permissions determine what they are authorized to do. For example, they may be authorized to access personal information about other users, or perform actions such as deleting another user's account.

## How do authentication vulnerabilities arise?

Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:

- The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against **brute-force attacks**.
- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called **"broken authentication"**.

In many areas of web development, logic flaws cause the website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, it's very likely that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues.
